# consumer-resource-many-resources

Jupyter notebook to simulate Strong Selection-Weak Mutation (SSWM) limit of evolutionary dynamics coupled to Macarthur's consumer resource model of community ecology with substitutable resources.  See bioRxiv preprint for details of the model and analysis: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/31/292821.  Scripts to run parallel simulations + recapitulate plots available upon request but presently in no state to share.
